# To run
    javac Process.java
    java Process

    Should proceed to run the test cases written in main.

# For official assignment
    Should be clearer about function "int get(String key)" return type - instructions say to return NULL.
    Provide format/process for test cases for ease of comparison/grading.
    More test cases and/or ways to test individual functions (ex. test "put" then search for the put value in the temp data, test that begin_transaction starts the process, etc.)
